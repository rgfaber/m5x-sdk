## Introduction

This is an opinionated library of various tools and classes that we have been carrying around from project to project since 2001; updating as we move along.

## M5x.DEC

The M5x.DEC.* namespace contains an SDK that supports **D**omain Driven Design - **E**vent Sourcing and **C**ommand Query Responsibility Segregation and Clean Architecture using the Event/Command Handler pattern. Built in support for EventStoreDB, CouchDB and NATS. Support for Redis (in order to support in-memory read models) and RabbitMQ/MassTransit is in the pipeline.
